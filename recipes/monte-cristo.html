        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The monte cristo is a classic I was taught by an old southern woman. It's the perfect mixture of sweet and salty. It's essentially a french toast sandwich with meat, cheese, and jelly. A very filling breakfast on its own, but it can be served with homefries or vegetables.</p>
